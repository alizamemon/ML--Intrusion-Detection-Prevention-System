# 🛡️ ML-Powered Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS)

## Problem Statement

Modern networks face an increasing number of cyberattacks such as DDoS, port scanning, and infiltration attempts. Traditional rule-based firewalls struggle to detect evolving attack patterns. This project addresses the problem by leveraging **Machine Learning** to intelligently detect malicious network traffic and automatically **prevent attackers in real time**.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

This project implements a complete **end-to-end Machine Learning–based Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS)** using network flow data from the **CICIDS 2017 dataset**.

A trained **Random Forest Classifier** analyzes network traffic and classifies it as either **BENIGN** or **ATTACK**. Once an attack is detected, a persistent **Prevention Module (IPS)** automatically blocks the malicious IP address. The entire system is visualized through a professional, interactive **Streamlit dashboard**.

This project demonstrates the **practical application of Machine Learning in cybersecurity**, bridging theory with real-world defense mechanisms.

## Core Components

1. **Detection (IDS):**
   - Random Forest classifier trained on CICIDS 2017 data
   - Handles class imbalance using **SMOTE**
   - High interpretability using feature importance

2. **Prevention (IPS):**
   - Automatically blocks attacking IPs
   - Maintains a persistent blacklist (`blocked_ips.csv`)
   - Simulates real firewall behavior

3. **Real-Time Dashboard:**
   - Built using **Streamlit**
   - Displays analytics, threats, and ML insights
   - Allows interactive IP blocking tests

##  Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Environment Setup

Create and activate a virtual environment, then install dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate

pip install pandas scikit-learn imbalanced-learn joblib streamlit numpy
```
### 2️⃣ Data Pipeline (One-Time Setup)
Run the following scripts in order to generate trained ML assets:

```bash
python step_merge.py
python step_clean.py
python step_split.py
python step_train.py
```
This will generate:
- rf_model.pkl → Trained Random Forest model
- scaler.pkl → Feature scaler

### 3️⃣ Detection & Prevention Simulation

Run the detection system on a mixed traffic sample:

```bash
python detection.py mixed_sample.csv
```
Malicious IPs are automatically added to: blocked_ips.csv

### 4️⃣ Launch the Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```
